# Abstract
Video scene classification is essential to satellite video intelligence analysis and understanding, which can describe the static and dynamic information of ground contents. Recently, studies on the satellite video single-label scene classification achieve great progress in this problem. However, a single label is not enough to describe such complex contents contained in a satellite video. And the lack of high-quality and large-scale dataset prevents the further improvement of the satellite video multi-label scene classification task. In this paper, (1) we develop the first publicly available and large-scale satellite video multi-label scene classification dataset named SAT-MTB-MLSC, which contains 18 static and dynamic classes, 3549 videos, and 141960 frames. (2) Based on the dataset, we propose a novel baseline method of satellite video multi-label scene classification with the Spatial and Temporal Feature Cooperative Encoding (STFCE). It exploits the relations between local details and models the motion features hidden in inter-frame variations to obtain powerful and robust feature representations of small ground objects. We also explore how the spatial, temporal, and motion features affect the satellite video multi-label scene classification performance and show that practically, the careful fusion and joint learning of these cues are beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate model. Experimental results show that our proposed STFCE outperforms 10 state-of-the-art methods including 6 CB-TDE methods (classification based on temporal and disordered features encoding), 3 CB-TOE methods (classification based on temporal and ordered features encoding) and 1 multi-model integration based method.It achieves a global average precision GAP of 0.8106.  Moreover, benchmarking results show that the proposed dataset is very challenging and has the potential to promote the further development of satellite video multi-label scene classification.
